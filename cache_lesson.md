# Cache - Lesson Draft 

## Exercise 1: Introduction
### Narrative
- Introduce analogy
  - food analogy (counter/pantry/supermarket)
  - tool analogy (hand/work bench/tool chest) from book
- Introduce cache using analogy
- Summarize lesson/exercises
### Instructions
**CP1**
Move to the next exercise to get started with Caches

## Exercise 2: Memory Hierarchy

### Narrative
- Processor/memory gap
- Big memory slow, small memory fast
- Registers -> Fast but small – Memory -> big but slow
- Let’s put something in between
### Checkpoints
**CP1**
- Explain the code to be used for the lesson.
- Ask the learner to configure the architecture to use main memory.
- Run the code

**Hint**

**CP2**

- Call the architecture `read_code()` method with `"code.txt"` as the argument.
- Run code, explain output.

## Exercise 3: Cache Memory

### Narrative
- Cache is made up of blocks
- Cache entries hold data and memory location
- For a memory request, the processor will check the cache first and will either result in a cache hit or a cache miss.
### Checkpoints
**CP1**
- Introduce Cache class (already implemented with `MainMemory` as next tier and `size` set)
- Learner will add the memory block variable(s)

**Hint**

**CP2**
- Create a class funtion `read()`.
- Inside the function call the parent class `read()` function using `super()` and place the return value in a variable called `byte`.
- return byte 

**Hint**

**CP3**

- In **app.py** create an instance of `Cache()` and put it in the variable `cache_memory` 
- Change memory of architecture to `cache_memory`

Run the code. Out put will be the same since `Cache()` is just a pass through for now.
